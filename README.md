# Lobbying firms from Cal-Access


The `scrape.ts` script will download all of the lobbying firms for a session as well as client and payment activity into a `.json` file.

It runs on Github Actions once a day to update the data for the current session. If the icon below is green, the last scrape was successful. If the scrape failed the icon will be red.
